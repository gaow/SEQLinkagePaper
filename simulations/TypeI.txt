Figure S1: Type I error evaluations for CHP method. Sequence data for gene SLC26A4 are simulated to evaluate type I error of CHP when the NSHI causal variants are absent and the gene is not linked to disease loci. We consider situations when (A) there is neither LD nor recombination events between rare variants in the gene, (B) there is a recombination event at each meiosis but the recombination breakpoints are different across families, and (C) there is complete LD between rare variant sites and one parental genotype is randomly missing from each family. Type I errors are evaluated using sum of HLOD scores across 20 families for 500 replicates. Type I errors are zero for all scenarios; distribution of HLOD scores are displayed in panels (A) to (C). The red line on each panel is the genome-wide significance level of HLOD = 3.6.
