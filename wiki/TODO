what's really left to do:
1. merlin output, mega2 output and docs thus missed
2. examples with merlin and the docs part
3. hang's blueprint
4. let Di check the output on example of linkage anlaysis in documentation
5. mac version support after permission to redistribute the executables
6. installation guide
7. make sure forum works
8. collect and organize result from simulation studies
I'll leave these alone for now and move on to new project until we start to finalize the project
